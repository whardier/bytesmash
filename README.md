# Managed (Python)

The `managed` tool is designed to simplify and enhance development workflows by automating the management of files and remote file tracking. This
functionality is particularly useful for generating common files, aggregating license information, and, akin to how dependency tracking works,
ensuring that local files remain up-to-date with minimal manual effort to check for external updates.

A practical application of `managed` is in handling `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files through action-based comments. For instance, a project could
merge and refine paths listed in both local (embedded or external) and online sources. This includes sourcing various `.gitignore` templates from the
internet to create a consolidated and reliable file that encompasses requirements for multiple languages or tools in a single document.
